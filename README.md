# OLA-Driver-Attrition-Prediction
***OLA Driver Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning***
- Formulated a predictive modeling approach to identify drivers at high risk of attrition using
demographic, tenure, performance, and income-related features.
- Performed end-to-end exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, encoding, and scaling to create
model-ready datasets.
- Trained and optimized ensemble models including Random Forest and Gradient Boosting using cross
validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Prioritized high recall to proactively flag at-risk drivers and interpreted feature importance to
generate actionable retention insights for business stakeholders.
***Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn,Ensemble model***
